3. If you've added code that should be tested, run the tests.

4. Add **Proper Documentation**. Docstring should be added to the added/modified `.py` files. If you're adding a new class to be initialized, please mention the initialization to the `README.md` within the directory.

5. Once everything is done, create a **Pull Request**. Wait for review to resolve any problems, and merging.
