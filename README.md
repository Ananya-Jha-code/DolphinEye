# dolphin-eye for vistually impaired

With just little aid to the visually impaired people existing currently, there is a need to implement a device that aids them in their daily activities. The existing systems such as Screen Reading software and Braille devices help visually impaired people to read and have access to various gadgets but these technologies become useless when the blind wants to carry out basic tasks, which involve detecting the scene in front of him, for instance, the people or objects. Further, little devices exist that facilitate communication between a blind and deaf-dumb. Our system will facilitate visually impaired people around the globe. dolphin-eye is made with an aim to help a person with detecting the object in front even with impaired eyesight and without the need of a guardian. The configuration of hardware and software units is to be designed, which leads to detecting and objects and people in the frame of vision and notifying the user about the same. We present a method, which uses object detection on the live stream of videos. The resultant object or person is then transmitted to the impaired person in the form of signal. The goal is to provide inexpensive solution to the visually impaired and make their life better and self-sufficient.
